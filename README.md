# MPC_SharedControl
This is the repository for the shared control implementation using the MiR gazebo simulation from DFKI while working under AI-hub Tampere project at Tampere University.

### The Different Branches
* This repository currently contains branches that contain code for shared control implemented using python and CasADi with ROS and Gazebo Simulation.
* Currently the codes have been tested on ROS Melodic with Ubuntu 18.04 LTS version and MATLAB 2020A. There are three branches one for Joystick control with Python MPC controller, one for Keyboard control for teleoperating the robot within the simulation environment and the final branch is the Joystick implementation with MPC controller running on MATLAB.
